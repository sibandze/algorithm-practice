Leetcode 3024 Type of Triangle
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size 3 which can form the sides of a triangle.

A triangle is called equilateral if it has all sides of equal length.
A triangle is called isosceles if it has exactly two sides of equal length.
A triangle is called scalene if all its sides are of different lengths.
Return a string representing the type of triangle that can be formed or "none" if it cannot form a triangle.
