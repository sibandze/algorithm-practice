LeetCode 3208 "Altering Groups II"
---

### **Algorithm Analysis: Altering Groups II**

This problem asks us to count the number of "alternating groups" of `k` contiguous tiles in a circular arrangement. An alternating group means that within that group of `k` tiles, colors strictly alternate (e.g., 0, 1, 0, 1...). The tiles are represented by an array `colors` where `0` is red and `1` is blue.

#### **Core Idea: Sliding Window with Circular Array and Longest Alternating Subsequence**

The problem involves two key aspects:
1.  **Circular Array:** The tiles form a circle, meaning the end wraps around to the beginning. This can be handled by using the modulo operator (`% n`) when accessing elements.
2.  **Alternating Colors:** We need `k` *contiguous* tiles where `colors[i] != colors[i+1]`.
3.  **Counting Groups:** We are counting groups of exactly length `k`.

The solution uses a sliding window approach, specifically tracking the length of the *current* alternating subsequence.

#### **Algorithm Breakdown**

1.  **Initialization:**
    * `n = len(colors)`: Get the number of tiles.
    * `count = 0`: Initialize a counter for the number of valid alternating groups.
    * `i = 0`: Initialize the left pointer of our dynamic window. This `i` marks the start of the current *unbroken* alternating sequence.

2.  **Extended Iteration for Circularity:**
    * `for j in range(1, n + k - 1):`: This loop is crucial for handling the circular nature of the array and ensuring all possible `k`-length windows are checked.
        * The loop iterates `n + k - 2` times.
        * `n` covers the full array.
        * `k - 1` additional iterations are needed to cover windows that wrap around from the end of the array to the beginning. For a window of size `k`, the last element `j` can go up to `n + k - 2` (if `i` starts at 0, the window `j - i + 1` needs to be `k`, so `j` needs to go `k-1` beyond `n-1`). The `colors[j%n]` ensures circular access.

3.  **Check for Alternating Pattern and Update Window:**
    * `if colors[j % n] == colors[(j - 1) % n]:`: This condition checks if the current tile `colors[j%n]` has the *same* color as the previous tile `colors[(j-1)%n]`.
        * If they are the same, the alternating sequence is broken. The `i` pointer must be reset to the current `j` position, as a new potential alternating sequence starts from `j`.
    * `elif j - i + 1 == k:`: This condition is checked only if the colors *do* alternate (`colors[j%n] != colors[(j-1)%n]`).
        * `j - i + 1` calculates the current length of the unbroken alternating subsequence ending at `j`.
        * If this length is exactly `k`, it means we've found a valid alternating group.
        * `count += 1`: Increment the counter.
        * `i += 1`: Importantly, after finding a valid group, we effectively slide the window by advancing `i`. This is because we are looking for *contiguous* groups. By advancing `i`, we discard the leftmost element of the current `k`-group and look for the next potential `k`-group that starts one position to the right.

4.  **Return Result:**
    * `return count`: Return the total number of alternating groups found.

#### **Example Trace (`colors = [0,1,0,1]`, `k = 3`)**

`n = 4`. Loop `j` from `1` to `4 + 3 - 1 - 1 = 5` (inclusive, meaning `j` takes values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
We'll map `j` to `colors[j%n]` and `colors[(j-1)%n]`

| j | j%n | colors[j%n] | (j-1)%n | colors[(j-1)%n] | `colors[j%n] == colors[(j-1)%n]` | `i` (start of current alt seq) | `j - i + 1` (current alt seq length) | `== k`? | `count` | Comments |
|---|-----|---------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|
|   |     |               |         |                   |                                   | 0                              |                                      |         | 0       | Initial  |
| 1 | 1   | 1             | 0       | 0                 | False                             | 0                              | 1 - 0 + 1 = 2                        | No      | 0       | `[0,1]`  |
| 2 | 2   | 0             | 1       | 1                 | False                             | 0                              | 2 - 0 + 1 = 3                        | Yes     | 1       | `[0,1,0]` is alternating. `i` becomes 1. |
| 3 | 3   | 1             | 2       | 0                 | False                             | 1                              | 3 - 1 + 1 = 3                        | Yes     | 2       | `[1,0,1]` is alternating. `i` becomes 2. |
| 4 | 0   | 0             | 3       | 1                 | False                             | 2                              | 4 - 2 + 1 = 3                        | Yes     | 3       | `[0,1,0]` (wraps) is alternating. `i` becomes 3. |
| 5 | 1   | 1             | 0       | 0                 | False                             | 3                              | 5 - 3 + 1 = 3                        | Yes     | 4       | `[1,0,1]` (wraps) is alternating. `i` becomes 4. |

Final `count = 4`.

Let's check manually for `[0,1,0,1]` and `k=3`:
1.  `[0,1,0]` - Yes
2.  `[1,0,1]` - Yes
3.  `[0,1,0]` (wraps around) - Yes
4.  `[1,0,1]` (wraps around) - Yes

The trace correctly identifies all 4 groups.

#### **Complexity Analysis**

Let $n$ be the length of the `colors` array.

* **Time Complexity:** $O(n + k)$
    * The `for` loop iterates `n + k - 2` times.
    * Inside the loop, operations like modulo (`%`), array access, and comparisons are all $O(1)$.
    * Therefore, the total time complexity is linear with respect to `n` and `k`, which simplifies to $O(n+k)$. Since `k` can be up to `n`, it is effectively $O(n)$.

* **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
    * The solution uses a fixed number of variables (`n`, `count`, `i`, `j`). No auxiliary data structures are used whose size depends on the input size.

#### **Advantages of this Algorithm**

* **Optimal Efficiency:** Achieves the best possible time and space complexity ($O(n+k)$ time, $O(1)$ space).
* **Elegant Handling of Circularity:** The `j % n` and `(j-1) % n` efficiently manage the circular array without creating a doubled array.
* **Single Pass:** The solution processes the (conceptual) extended array in a single pass using the sliding window approach.
* **Concise Logic:** The core logic within the loop is compact and effectively tracks the alternating sequence length.
