**Leetcode 2566: Maximum Difference By Remapping A Digit**

This solution addresses the problem of finding the maximum difference between two numbers derived from the input `num` by remapping a single digit. The core strategy is to maximize one resulting number (`max_num`) and minimize the other (`min_num`) independently.

Let's break down the solution's logic:

**1. Digit Extraction and Identification:**

The initial part of the code determines the number of digits (`n`) in `num` and then extracts each digit, storing them in the `digits` list. Importantly, this section also identifies two crucial digits:

* `first_none_9_digit`: This variable aims to find the **first (leftmost) digit in `num` that is not a '9'**. This digit will be the target for remapping to '9' to achieve the maximum possible value.
* `first_none_0_digit`: This variable aims to find the **first (leftmost) digit in `num` that is not a '0'**. This digit will be the target for remapping to '0' to achieve the minimum possible value.

The loop iterates through `num` by repeatedly taking the modulo (`%10`) and integer division (`//10`), effectively processing digits from right to left (least significant to most significant). However, the way `first_none_9_digit` and `first_none_0_digit` are updated ensures that they correctly capture the *first occurrence from the left* (most significant position) of a non-9 or non-0 digit, respectively. If all digits are '9' (for `first_none_9_digit`) or all digits are '0' (which is impossible for `num >= 1`, but theoretically), these variables would remain `None`.

**2. Constructing `max_num`:**

To obtain the maximum possible number:
* The strategy is to find the first digit (from the left) in `num` that is not '9'.
* All occurrences of this identified digit are then remapped to '9'.
* If `num` consists entirely of '9's (e.g., `num = 999`), `first_none_9_digit` will remain `None`, and `max_num` will simply be the original `num`, which is the correct maximum as no larger number can be formed.

The loop iterates through the `digits` array (which is now ordered from left to right, most significant digit first) and applies this remapping.

**3. Constructing `min_num`:**

To obtain the minimum possible number:
* The strategy is to find the first digit (from the left) in `num` that is not '0'.
* All occurrences of this identified digit are then remapped to '0'.
* A key constraint here is that the resulting number *can* have leading zeros (e.g., `11891` remapping '1' to '0' results in `00890`). This simplifies the minimization, as there's no special handling needed for the first digit to avoid a leading zero (unlike the previous problem).

Similarly, the loop iterates through the `digits` array and applies this remapping.

**4. Calculating the Difference:**

Finally, the function returns the difference between the constructed `max_num` and `min_num`.

**Correctness:**

The logic correctly identifies the optimal digits to remap for both maximization and minimization. The `first_none_9_digit` and `first_none_0_digit` variables effectively capture the most impactful digit to change from the perspective of numerical value (i.e., the leftmost non-9 or non-0 digit). The handling of cases where all digits are already '9' (for max) or where digits are '0' (for min) is also correct.

**Time Complexity:**

Let $N$ be the number of digits in `num`.
1.  **Counting digits (`while` loop):** This operation takes $O(N)$ time as it performs a division for each digit.
2.  **Extracting digits and identifying target digits (`for` loop):** This loop iterates $N$ times, performing constant-time operations within each iteration (modulo, integer division, list access, comparisons, assignments). Thus, this part takes $O(N)$ time.
3.  **Initializing variables:** These are constant time $O(1)$ operations.
4.  **Constructing `max_num` and `min_num` (`for` loop):** This loop also iterates $N$ times, performing constant-time operations in each iteration. This takes $O(N)$ time.
5.  **Final calculation:** This is a constant time $O(1)$ operation.

Combining these, the total time complexity of the solution is **$O(N)$**. Since the number of digits $N$ is proportional to $\log_{10}(\text{num})$, the time complexity can also be expressed as **$O(\log(\text{num}))$**. Given the constraint `1 <= num <= 10^8`, $N$ is at most 9, making the solution very efficient.

**Space Complexity:**

The solution uses a list `digits` to store all the digits of `num`. The size of this list is $N$.
Therefore, the space complexity is **$O(N)$**, or **$O(\log(\text{num}))$**. For the given constraints, this is effectively constant space as $N$ is small.
